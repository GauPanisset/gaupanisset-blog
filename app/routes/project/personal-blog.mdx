## Why?

During my free time, I enjoy doing side projects. They come to my mind suddenly during the night, while walking to the office or in the bathroom. 
I write a few words about them on a Notion page as reminders and eventually end up working on them.

There are a lot of different subjects! They are not all useful, and they are not all very technically challenging but they are fun (at least to me) 
and make me learn or practice something. I started coding some of them and « finished » a few, but I couldn't share my adventures through their development. 
However, I feel that my experiences building some projects, my researches on some subjects, and my general thoughts were worthy of sharing. 

That's why I created this blog.
