## Why?

As a lot of tech companies, Goshaba became full remote during the pandemic. 
But as soon as the world was allowed to go out, some of use wanted to be able 
to meet again in an office. That is why, Goshaba chose the co-working solution 
named _WeWork_.

_WeWork_ offers a dozen of offices in Paris (and even more all around the world). 
But you actually need to register a desk or a room in order to have access to 
the building. However, on _WeWork_ web platform the user can only manage his 
reservations and can't see those of his co-workers.

**Problem:**\
**How can we meet, if we don't know where and when the others took their reservations?** 

At first, we just tried to communicate with our messaging tools like Slack or Whatsapp,
but it partially solved the problem. Either we forgot to share our reservations or we 
always shared them with the same co-workers.

**Problem 2:**\
**How can we automatically share our reservations with all co-workers?**

That's why I though a Chrome extension would be a great solution.
In fact, it can enhance a already existing application. Therefor, we
will not have to adopt a new process or a new behavior or a new
application. Instead, we will just keep using the same things but with
the feature we needed.\
And I confess, I was pretty excited about this solution because I had
never built a Chrome extension before!

## _WeWork_ API exploration

As usual after coming up with an idea, I need to check if it is
technically feasible. That's why I opened my browser and inspect
the _WeWork_ platform.\
The goal was to find a way to retrieve the reservations. Quite simple,
I have an account so I can log in and visit the reservation page.

/>

In the previous image, you can see there is a request fetching the reservations:

<p style={{overflowX: "auto"}}>`https://rooms.wework.com/api/v7/reservations`</p>

You can also spot their filtering syntax. In fact, they use query params to filter 
the data sent back in the response:

<p style={{overflowX: "auto"}}>`?filter[user_uuid]=d2e64122-96b3-4088-8c65-e6d55fc29d47`</p>

Ok now, let's have a look to the response and see what is the shape of a reservation:

```json
{
  "id": "d8d9f5d1-1a71-404b-afb7-2e61bc151259",
  "type": "reservations",
  "attributes": {
    "uuid": "d8d9f5d1-1a71-404b-afb7-2e61bc151259",
    "start": "2022-08-21T22:00:00.000Z",
    "finish": "2022-08-22T21:59:00.000Z",
    "location_uuid": "3e18355f-a805-4732-a8fd-30f206492a5d",
    "reservable_uuid": "55041ea8-1f87-11e7-a929-22000bfdfd88",
    "user_uuid": "d2e64122-96b3-4088-8c65-e6d55fc29d47",
    "company_uuid": "ef3fe116-b5e5-443d-a130-a99843c079fb",
    "reservable_type": "DailyDesk"
  }
}
``` 

A field may have caught you attention: `company_uuid`. Yes, for this project I wanted 
to retrieve the reservations of the whole company. So if I am lucky (and I will) setting 
the following query params will do the job: 

<p style={{overflowX: "auto"}}>`filter[company_uuid]=ef3fe116-b5e5-443d-a130-a99843c079fb`</p>

 At this point, I knew I would be able to retrieve all Goshaba's reservations. 
 But there were still two issues:
 1. The endpoint is protected, meaning I should be logged in to be able to access the API.
 2. As you can see, the reservation data does not contain any human readable information. 
 So I don't have the details of the location, the reservable or the user.

The first point was quite easy to solve. A lot of web applications store the `access_token` 
used to authenticate the requests in the local storage of the browser.

<Image

  caption="https://members.wework.com"
  src="https://gaupanisset-blog.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/wework-team/wework-api-exploration-2.jpg"
/>

As you can see, _WeWork_ does it too and a Chrome extension can read the local storage. 
So it was simple to get the token.

The second point was not much harder thanks to a query parameter in the first request: 
`include=location,reservable`. This add complementary data to the response. 
So I just had to ask for location, reservable and user details with this parameter.

## First attempt: enhance _WeWork_ web application

Once I could retrieve the data I needed, I had to design the extension
and define how the information should be displayed?\
Usually I draw some sketches to help me visualize my thoughts. Here is
the last one:\

<Image
  alt="sketch of the wework 'book a desk' page with the extension enhancement"
  caption="Sketch of the wework 'book a desk' page"
  src="https://gaupanisset-blog.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/wework-team/first-attempt.jpg"
/>

This sketch shows the "book a desk" page of the
_WeWork_ application. In this page you have two important
elements. First, the selects on the top, enabling the user to choose
the date, the city, etc... Below, the list of office cards. Each card
allows the user to book a desk in the specific location.\
In blue, I drew what I wanted to add in this page. It is basically the
list of users who have already registered a desk in the given
location.

I think it perfectly fits the needs since the user can see who he
could meet if he also take the reservation. Then, he can check all the
locations and optionally change the date if he wants to work with
someone else.

To code the extension I used React and more specifically
`react-create-app`. This choice is only based on the fact
that it was the TypeScript framework I knew the most. Moreover, there
are plenty of articles explaining the basic configuration to use this
stack.\
I have to confess that it was a bit overkill at first. Because
you only have to write some React for building the extension popup and
in my first attempt I haven't planned to develop it.

## Second attempt: reservation calendar
