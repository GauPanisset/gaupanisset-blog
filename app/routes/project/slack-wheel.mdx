## Technical stack

- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to ease deployment.
- [gif-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gif-encoder) and
  [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) to create `.gif`.
- [Slack API](https://api.slack.com) to communicate with Slack.
