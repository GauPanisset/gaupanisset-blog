    "text": "Why? As a lot of tech companies, Goshaba became full remote during the pandemic. But as soon as the world was allowed to go out, some of use wanted to be able to meet again in an office. That is why, Goshaba chose the co-working solution named WeWork.WeWork offers a dozen of offices in Paris (and even more all around the world). But you actually need to register a desk or a room in order to have access to the building. However, on WeWork web platform the user can only manage his reservations and can't see those of his co-workers.Problem:How can we meet, if we don't know where and when the others took their reservations?At first, we just tried to communicate with our messaging tools like Slack or Whatsapp, but it partially solved the problem. Either we forgot to share our reservations or we always shared them with the same co-workers.Problem 2:How can we automatically share our reservations with all co-workers?That's why I though a Chrome extension would be a great solution. In fact, it can enhance a already existing application. Therefor, we will not have to adopt a new process or a new behavior or a new application. Instead, we will just keep using the same things but with the feature we needed.And I confess, I was pretty excited about this solution because I had never built a Chrome extension before!WeWork API explorationAs usual after coming up with an idea, I need to check if it is technically feasible. That's why I opened my browser and inspect the WeWork platform.The goal was to find a way to retrieve the reservations. Quite simple, I have an account so I can log in and visit the reservation page.wework 'your bookings' page on the left and the developer console showing the network traffic on the righthttps://members.wework.com/your-bookingsIn the previous image, you can see there is a request fetching the reservations:https://rooms.wework.com/api/v7/reservationsYou can also spot their filtering syntax. In fact, they use query params to filter the data sent back in the response:?filter[user_uuid]=d2e64122-96b3-4088-8c65-e6d55fc29d47Ok now, let's have a look to the response and see what is the shape of a reservation:{    \"id\": \"d8d9f5d1-1a71-404b-afb7-2e61bc151259\",    \"type\": \"reservations\",    \"attributes\": {        \"uuid\": \"d8d9f5d1-1a71-404b-afb7-2e61bc151259\",        \"start\": \"2022-08-21T22:00:00.000Z\",        \"finish\": \"2022-08-22T21:59:00.000Z\",        \"location_uuid\": \"3e18355f-a805-4732-a8fd-30f206492a5d\",        \"reservable_uuid\": \"55041ea8-1f87-11e7-a929-22000bfdfd88\",        \"user_uuid\": \"d2e64122-96b3-4088-8c65-e6d55fc29d47\",        \"company_uuid\": \"ef3fe116-b5e5-443d-a130-a99843c079fb\",        \"reservable_type\": \"DailyDesk\"    }}A field may have caught you attention: company_uuid. Yes, for this project I wanted to retrieve the reservations of the whole company. So if I am lucky (and I will) setting the following query params will do the job: filter[company_uuid]=ef3fe116-b5e5-443d-a130-a99843c079fbAt this point, I knew I would be able to retrieve all Goshaba's reservations. But there were still two issues:The endpoint is protected, meaning I should be logged in to be able to access the API.As you can see, the reservation data does not contain any human readable information. So I don't have the details of the location, the reservable or the user.The first point was quite easy to solve. A lot of web applications store the access_token used to authenticate the requests in the local storage of the browser.wework 'landing' page on the left and the developer console showing the application local storage on the righthttps://members.wework.comAs you can see, WeWork does it too and a Chrome extension can read the local storage. So it was simple to get the token.The second point was not much harder thanks to a query parameter in the first request: include=location,reservable. This add complementary data to the response. So I just had to ask for location, reservable and user details with this parameter.First attempt: enhance WeWork web applicationOnce I could retrieve the data I needed, I had to design the extension and define how the information should be displayed?Usually I draw some sketches to help me visualize my thoughts. Here is the last one:sketch of the wework 'book a desk' page with the extension enhancementSketch of the wework 'book a desk' pageThis sketch shows the \"book a desk\" page of the WeWork application. In this page you have two important elements. First, the selects on the top, enabling the user to choose the date, the city, etc... Below, the list of office cards. Each card allows the user to book a desk in the specific location.In blue, I drew what I wanted to add in this page. It is basically the list of users who have already registered a desk in the given location.I think it perfectly fits the needs since the user can see who he could meet if he also take the reservation. Then, he can check all the locations and optionally change the date if he wants to work with someone else.To code the extension I used React and more specifically react-create-app. This choice is only based on the fact that it was the TypeScript framework I knew the most. Moreover, there are plenty of articles explaining the basic configuration to use this stack.I have to confess that it was a bit overkill at first. Because you only have to write some React for building the extension popup and in my first attempt I haven't planned to develop it.Second attempt: reservation calendar",

They come to my mind suddenly during the night, while walking to the office or in the bathroom and I write a few words about them in a Notion page as reminders.  There are a lot of different things! They are not all useful, they are not all very technically challenging but they are fun (at least to me) and make me learn or practice something. I started coding some of them and I ¬´ finished ¬ª a few, but I couldn't share my adventures through their development. However, I feel that my experiences building some projects, my researches on some subjects or my general thoughts was worthy sharing. That's why I created this blog.  Be careful! After this point everything is just rough ideas I still need to polish. Main ideas The main goal of this blog is to share my projects.
