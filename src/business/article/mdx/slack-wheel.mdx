title: Slack wheel
description:
  At the office, lunchtime decisions got a facelift. Tired of the 'Where do we
  eat?' dilemma, I whipped up a spinning wheel. Now, with just a spin on Slack,
  lunch destiny is decided. No more lunchtime debates.

gpt-prompt:
  - The idea of displaying a random wheel on Slack sound crazy because we can
    easily imagine more simple solution (for example just pick a random element
    on a list)
  - The idea comes from a discussion with none-tech guy. I wanted show that "we
    can do everthing, but it always comes with a cost".
  - I created a spinning wheel on a canvas, then animated it and generate a
    .gif. The .gif was stored on a S3 (add a short description of AWS S3) which
    made me practice the streams.
  - I add the blocks to communicate with Slack (btw they did a really good job
    about integration it was really fluid)
  - I deployed it with Serverless which is a framework I really love because it
    helps me to bring to life project really quickly.

## Why?

Imagine this at the office: the eternal lunch debate—'Where do we eat?' I
decided to inject a bit of crazy into the mix. Instead of a straightforward
solution like picking a random element from a list, I went all-in and built a
spinning wheel that dishes out a random answer right there on Slack. Why? Well,
because simplicity is overrated, and I wanted to prove a point.

This idea started with a chat with a non-tech buddy. I wanted to demonstrate
that while we can do anything (even if there's always a cost). So, I got to
work. Created a wheel on a canvas, spinned it with animations, and transformed
it into a .gif, stored it on a AWS S3 (a storage solution) and plug the Slack
API for communication. I must say, Slack did an impressive job with integrations
— smooth sailing all the way.

The final touch? Deployment with Serverless, a framework I swear by. It's one of
my go-to when I want to bring projects to life in a flash. Lunch decisions are
now a spin away, thanks to a bit of craziness and a whole lot of tech magic!"

## Technical stack

- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to ease deployment.
- [gif-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gif-encoder) and
  [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) to create a .gif.
- [Slack API](https://api.slack.com) to communicate with Slack.
