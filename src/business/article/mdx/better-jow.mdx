title: Better Jow
description:
  Jow is a fantastic app that helps me plan my weekly groceries. However, after
  a few months, I noticed their suggestion system could use some improvement.
  So, I wrote my own suggestion algorithm and injected it into the web app using
  a browser extension!

I absolutely love using Jow because it saves me so much time! I often find
myself clueless about what to eat or what to pick up at the grocery store. I've
been a fan since they launched, but lately, I've noticed it takes longer to get
a good set of meal suggestions. Their algorithm doesn’t seem as powerful as it
used to be.

On the bright side, I’m a huge fan of browser extensions — they're great for
adding missing features or tweaking the web experience. Developing these
extensions can be tricky, though, because you need to understand the web app
inside out. So, I spent some time reverse-engineering Jow. By the way, LLMs are
fantastic assistants for this, especially when you're deciphering minified
source code. Everything becomes so much clearer with their help!

I decided to create my own suggestion algorithm using Jow's as a base but with
some added steps. I wanted to avoid suggesting recipes I’ve already chosen in
the past 30 days and limit the number of long recipes since I need some quick
meals during the week. Plus, I aimed for a good variety of recipes. By keeping
Jow's algorithm, I didn't have to worry about managing recipe storage and
updates. And I could still use all their features like user preferences and
tools, ensuring that the recipes suggested are ones I can actually eat and make.

Finally, I replaced the submit button with my own, complete with an awesome
shiny effect, to maintain the same user experience.

I might add more rules in the future, like considering recipe calories or
reducing food waste.
