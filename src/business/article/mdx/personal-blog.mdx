## Why?

During my free time, I enjoy doing side projects. They come to my mind suddenly
during the night, while walking to the office or in the bathroom. I write a few
words about the idea on a Notion page as reminders and eventually end up working
on them.

There are a lot of different subjects! They are not all useful, and they are not
all very technically challenging but they are fun (at least to me) and make me
learn or practice something. I started coding some of them and « finished » a
few, but I couldn't share my adventures through their development. However, I
feel that my experiences building some projects, my researches on some subjects,
and my general thoughts were worthy of sharing.

That's why I created this blog.

## Technical stack

- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) as development framework.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to write the blog posts.
- [Remix run](https://remix.run/doc) to have a very fast blog.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/docs) for animations and transitions.
