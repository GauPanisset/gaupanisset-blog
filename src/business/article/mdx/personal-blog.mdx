  I've created a personal blog to play around with new tech. In this blog, I
  will share my projects, maybe some articles, thoughts, or stories about my
  developer experiences.

## Why?

During my free time, I enjoy doing side projects. Ideas pop up randomly - could
be during the night, while walking to the office or in the bathroom. I write a
few words about the idea on a Notion page as reminders and eventually end up
working on them.

These ventures cover a range of topicsâ€” not all practical, not all super
complex, but always fun (at least for me). They're a playground for learning and
practicing something new. While I've coded and 'finished' a few, I missed
sharing the journey.

That's why I created this blog.

## Technical stack

- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) as development framework.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to write the blog posts.
- [Remix run](https://remix.run/doc) to have a very fast blog.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/docs) for animations and transitions.
