description:
  WeWork offers a user to register a room or a desk in a coworking space.
  However, it is not possible to see our colleagues' reservations. So I decided
  to create a Chrome Extension to meet this need.

## Why?

Like a lot of tech companies, Goshaba became full-remote during the pandemic.
But as soon as the world was allowed to go out, some of us wanted to be able to
meet again in an office. That is why Goshaba chose the co-working solution named
_WeWork_.

_WeWork_ offers a dozen of offices in Paris (and even more all around the
world). But you actually need to register a desk or a room in order to have
access to the building. However, on _WeWork_ web platform the user can only
manage his reservations and can't see those of his co-workers.

**Problem:**\
**How can we meet, if we don't know where and when the others took their reservations?**

At first, we just tried to communicate with our messaging tools like Slack or
Whatsapp, but it partially solved the problem. Either we forgot to share our
reservations or we always shared them with the same co-workers.

**Problem 2:**\
**How can we automatically share our reservations with all co-workers?**

That's why I thought a Chrome extension would be a great solution. In fact, it
can enhance an already existing application. Therefore, we will not have to
adopt a new process or a new behavior, or a new application. Instead, we will
just keep using the same things but with the feature we needed.\
And I confess, I was pretty excited about this solution because I had never built
a Chrome extension before!
