description:
  At WeWork, you can book a room or desk, but seeing your colleagues'
  reservations? Nope. So, I took matters into my own hands and cooked up a
  Chrome Extension to fill that gap. Now, no more guessing who's where. Simple
  as that!

## Why?

Like many tech companies, Goshaba went full-remote during the pandemic. But as
soon as the world opened up, some of us craved that in-person office vibe again.
Enter _WeWork_, our co-working savior.

With dozens of offices in Paris and beyond, WeWork became our go-to. Here's the
catch: you gotta snag a desk or room reservation to get in. But guess what? On
the _WeWork_ web platform, you can only handle your own bookings, not your
co-workers'.

**Dilemma:**\
**How do we plan meetups if we're in the dark about where and when others booked?**

First, we tried the usual approches â€” Slack, WhatsApp. It helped a bit, but we
always ended up forgetting to share or just stuck in a loop with the same
buddies.

**New Problem:**\
**How do we effortlessly share reservations with everyone automatically?**

That's why I thought a Chrome extension would be a great solution. Why? Because
it doesn't force us into a new process or app. We get to stick to what we know,
just with the added feature we desperately needed.\
And I confess, I was pretty excited about this solution because I had never built
a Chrome extension before!
