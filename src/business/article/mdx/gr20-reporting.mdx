title: GR20 Reporting
description:
  The GR20 is a mythic hike across the whole of Corsica, France. I've achieved
  this adventure and I wanted to share my 14 days journey in a web app.

  - I built a little technical demo but it's still far from the initial idea
  - I also publish on daily basis my journey on Strava, but I wanted something
    more fun
  - I wanted to create a narrative game with an accent on people we met during
    the adventure and what we shared with them
  - As I wanted to display the real path (from .pgx files) I learn some powerful
    algorithms (Douglas-Peucker & Catmull-Rom) to simplify (motivated by
    performance issues) or enhance (motivated by visual design) the path.

## Why?

Took on the epic GR20 hike in Corsica, and the adventure didn't stop at the
trails. I'm in the midst of turning this 14-day journey into a web app, though
it's more of a tech demo for now, far from the grand vision I have in mind.

Sure, I've been posting my daily exploits on Strava, but I felt the need for
something more engaging. That's when the idea of a narrative game popped up.
It's not just about documenting the paths; it's about the people we crossed
paths with, the stories we shared, and the bonds formed amidst the Corsican
landscapes.

Digging into the technical side, I grappled with the challenge of displaying the
real path from .gpx files. That led me down the rabbit hole of powerful
algorithms like Douglas-Peucker and Catmull-Rom. Why? Well, for one, performance
issues nudged me towards simplifying the path. On the flip side, the visual
aesthetic called for enhancements.

## Technical stack

- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) as development framework.
- [D3 geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#api-reference) as geography helper.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) to
  visualize components independently.
