title: Browser Support
description:
  Browser support is often neglected when a developper implements a design, even
  if key player in delivering a seamless user experience. Recognizing this gap,
  I crafted a Chrome Extension dedicated to unveiling the browser support
  details of the website currently in view.

gpt-prompt:
  - when building a product you never know precisely with what browsers your are
    compatible. But one day, your customer/user ask a minimal browser version.
    So you answer "Mmh yeah, let's say it's the version of two of years ago".
  - I wanted to be able to precisely know, so I build some code to extract all
    the properties used in a web page and retrieve the minimal browser version
    to be able to use them.
  - Quite challenging since we are far from the web styled by only inline styles
    or some css files. We have now css in js injecting the style somewhere in
    the page, css variables, etc...
  - The extension is still a bit buggy but it's a fun POC

## Why?

In the world of making stuff for the web, knowing exactly which browsers will
play nice can be a real head-scratcher. Picture this: a customer asks for a
specific browser version, and you're like, 'Mmmh yeaah, let's go with something
from two years ago, maybe?'

Frustrated by this guessing game, I cooked up some code magic. It dives into the
nitty-gritty of a web page, sniffs out all the technical bits, and figures out
the minimum browser version needed.

Sounds easy, right? Nope. Web styling has come a long way from simple
stylesheets. Now, we've got CSS doing acrobatics in JavaScript, playing with
variables, and whatnot.

And voila! The result is this Chrome Extension of mine. Sure, it's a bit finicky
right now, but it was a fun experiment.

## Technical stack

- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) with
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) as development framework.
- [Craco](https://github.com/dilanx/craco#documentation) to override the default
  configuration of CRA.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.
- [MDN](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) for the data.
