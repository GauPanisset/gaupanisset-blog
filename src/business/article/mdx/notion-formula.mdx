  formula (v1) was a bit of a headache. Solution? Decided to roll up my sleeves
  and craft a user-friendly editor.

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components.
- [MathJS](https://mathjs.org/) for math/formula helpers. Notion was also using
  this library.
